# JOAT DbEdit #

This little program was written first as an extension for [BeyondCompare](http://www.scootersoftware.com) to compare files that were stored in a SQLServer database.  The files may be any text such as scripts, XML, XAML, etc.

[Full details for using DbEdit can be found here](Help.md)

## History ##
This was a little side project originally created as a [BeyondCompare](http://www.scootersoftware.com) plugin that allowed it to compare and edit configuration files stored in a database.  Now I'm giving back to the community in my first OpenSource project and hope someone finds it useful.
